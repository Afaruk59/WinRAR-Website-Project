                        <li>There are 2 basic types of licenses issued for the software. These are:
                            <br>
                            <br>

                                <li>A single computer usage license. The user purchases one license to use the software
                                    on one computer.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Home users may use their single computer usage license on all computers and mobile
                                    devices (USB drive, external hard drive, etc.) which are property of the license
                                    owner.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Business users require one license per computer or mobile device on which the
                                    software is installed.
                                    <br>&nbsp;<br>
                                </li>
                                <li>A multiple usage license. The user purchases a number of usage licenses for use, by
                                    the purchaser or the purchaser's employees on the same number of computers.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    In a network (server/client) environment the user must purchase a license copy for
                                    each separate client (workstation) on which the software is installed, used or
                                    accessed. A separate license copy for each client (workstation) is needed regardless
                                    of whether the clients (workstations) will use the software simultaneously or at
                                    different times. If for example you wish to have 9 different clients (workstations)
                                    in your network with access to RAR, you must purchase 9 license copies.
                                    <br>&nbsp;<br>
                                </li>

                            A user who purchased a license, is granted a non-exclusive right to use the software on as
                            many computers as defined by the licensing terms above according to the number of licenses
                            purchased, for any legal purpose.
                            <br>&nbsp;<br>
                        </li>
                        <li>There are no additional license fees, apart from the cost of the license, associated with
                            the creation and distribution of RAR archives, volumes, self-extracting archives or
                            self-extracting volumes. Owners of a license may use their copies of the software to produce
                            archives and self-extracting archives and to distribute those archives free of any
                            additional royalties.
