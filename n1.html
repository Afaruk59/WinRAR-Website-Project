                            Compression dictionary sizes larger than 1 GB are supported
                          for RAR archive format. Depending on the amount of physically
                          available memory, dictionary up to 64 GB can be selected.
                            <br>&nbsp;<br>
                            Not power of 2 dictionary sizes can be specified for dictionaries
                          exceeding 4 GB. So we are not limited to 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 series
                          and can use values like 5 GB or 22 GB.
                            <br>&nbsp;<br>
                            Archives with dictionaries exceeding 4 GB can be unpacked only
                          by WinRAR 7.0 or newer.
                            <br>&nbsp;<br>
                            Increasing the dictionary size can improve the compression ratio
                          for large files with distant repeated blocks, like virtual machine
                          disk images. It also can be efficient for sets of large similar files
                          in a solid archive, such as a collection of software ISO images
                          differing by version or localization.

                        <li>
                            WinRAR issues a prompt allowing to cancel or continue if dictionary
                          size in extracted RAR archive exceeds "Maximum dictionary size
                          allowed to extract" parameter in "Settings/Compression".
                          It is done to prevent the unexpected excessive memory allocation.
                            <br>&nbsp;<br>
                            In the command line mode by default WinRAR refuses to unpack archives
                          with dictionary exceeding 4 GB. Use -md or -mdx to allow
                          unpacking dictionaries up to and including the specified size.
                          Unlike -md, -mdx is applied to extraction only and can be
                          added to RAR environment variable, not affecting archiving commands.
                            <br>&nbsp;<br>

                        <li>
                            "Define dictionary sizes" dialog in "Settings/Compression" can be used
                          to customize dictionary sizes proposed in the drop down list associated
                          with "Dictionary size" field in "Archive name and parameters" dialog.
                            <br>&nbsp;<br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Alternate search algorithm, optimized to locate longer and more distant
                          repeated data blocks, can be used when creating RAR archives.
                          It helps to improve the compression ratio and sometimes speed
                          for redundant data like big text files.
                            <br>&nbsp;<br>
                            It increases memory usage and might reduce the compression speed
                          for some types of data. It can be turned on or off with
                          "Long range search" options in "Advanced compression parameters" dialog
                          or with -mcl[+|-] switch. If "Auto" option is selected, WinRAR applies
                          the long range search depending on the compression method, dictionary
                          size and other parameters.
                            <br>&nbsp;<br>
                            This algorithm is required for dictionaries exceeding 4 GB
                          and turning it off is ignored for such dictionaries.
                            <br>&nbsp;<br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Much slower and more exhaustive repeated data search and compression
                          algorithm can be enabled with "Exhaustive search" option
                          in "Advanced compression parameters" dialog or with -mcx switch.
                          It might provide the additional compression gain for some types of
                          redundant data, but at much lower compression speed.
                            <br>&nbsp;<br>
                            Long range search is needed to implement this mode efficiently,
                          so the exhaustive search option activates it automatically.
                            <br>&nbsp;<br>
                            Both long range and exhaustive search option do not affect
                          the compatibility of created archives. So if dictionary size
                          is in 128 KB - 4 GB range, archives created with these search options
                          can be unpacked by all WinRAR versions beginning from 5.0.
                            <br>&nbsp;<br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Maximum path length limit is increased from 2047 to 65535 characters.

                            Creating archives in RAR 4.x format isn't supported anymore.
                          Options and switches specific for this format are removed.
                          It doesn't affect RAR 4.x archives decompression, which is included
                          into WinRAR.

                          controls assigning the archive Mark of the Web to extracted files.
                          It is possible to prohibit propagating, allow it for several
                          predefined file groups, for all files or for files matching user
                          defined file masks.
                            <br>&nbsp;<br>
                            Mark of the Web is the security zone information added by Internet
                          browsers to downloaded files. It can be used by various software
                          for security purposes.
                            <br>&nbsp;<br>
                            It is supported only by GUI WinRAR. Console RAR doesn't propagate
                          Mark of the Web regardless of this option.
                            <br>&nbsp;<br>
                        </li>

                            "Attributes" column can be enabled in "Settings/File list/Columns".
                          It displays file attribute abbreviations, such as 'A' for "Archive"
                          and 'D' for directory.
                            <br>&nbsp;<br>
                            If file attribute isn't among those recognized by WinRAR,
                          the numeric value of file attributes is also displayed.
                          This value uses hexadecimal format for Windows attributes
                          or octal format for Unix attributes.

                            "Benchmark" command allows to specify the exact number of threads
                          and copy results to clipboard. Information about WinRAR and Windows
                          versions, CPU and memory is added to benchmark window.

                            "Remove redundant folders from extraction path" option
                          in "Settings/Paths" is now applicable also to extraction commands
                          invoked from WinRAR user interface and to multiple archives
                          unpacked to separate folders. It removes a destination path
                          component, only if its name matches both the archive name and root
                          archived folder name, provided that there are no other folders
                          or files in archive root.
                            <br>&nbsp;<br>
                            For example, it will remove one of "Pictures" in the destination path
                          if we unpack Pictures.rar containing the root "Pictures" folder
                          to "Pictures\" destination.
                            <br>&nbsp;<br>
                            Previously it worked only for a single archive extracted from
                          context menu and didn't check if archived folder name matches
                          the last destination path component.

                          user can access it. It prohibits a local user to replace files
                          in a temporary folder if SFX is started under another account.
                            <br>&nbsp;<br>
                            It also can be enabled with "Restrict folder access" option

                          entries refer to. It allows to reduce the archive size, because

                          also while search is still in progress. Previously they were available
                          only after completing search.
