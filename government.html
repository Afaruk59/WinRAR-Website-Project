                <p class="bodytext">Using data encryption in government institutions should be mandatory.

                <p class="bodytext">With WinRAR, users can set passwords for files and archives, which will not only encrypt the names with AES 256-bit encryption technology but will also encrypt the metadata too, making it virtually impossible for the contents of the files to be guessed or intercepted. These archives and files can then be safely stored on mobile devices and in the cloud.
                </p>
                <p class="bodytext">With the ability to set up Administrator rights, organizations are in complete control over the data they store and, more importantly, over who can access it. WinRAR’s built-in password manager is also a very useful addition to an already extensive arsenal, helping users to keep track of the many and difficult passwords required to keep sensitive data away from prying eyes.
                </p>
                <p class="bodytext">WinRAR automatically stores the exact time that a file or archive was modified thanks to its time-stamping feature. The software also offers further control to system administrators regarding when and by whom data is being accessed. This goes hand in hand with WinRAR’s built-in back up options and its lock archive function, which prevents any accidental file modification.
                </p>
                <p class="bodytext">Setting the recovery record with WinRAR can help with restoring damaged archives. Used alongside existing anti-virus tools, WinRAR can also scan files and archives for malicious content before the data is unpacked onto users’ computers.
                </p>
                <p class="bodytext">WinRAR’s knowledgeable Sales &amp; Support team have over 25 years of expertise. WinRAR is the leading software for file and data compression and encryption, used by Government departments all over the world. Compliancy with the GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations has never been easier using WinRAR’s AES 256-bit encryption solutions.</p></div><div id="c14503" class="csc-default"><p class="bodytext"><a href="industries.html" class="backlink">&lt;- Back to: Industry Sectors</a></p></div><!--TYPO3SEARCH_end--></div>
